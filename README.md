# Fractional Knapsack Problem

----
Given weights and values of n items, we need to put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack.

#  0-1 Knapsack problem
----
In the 0-1 Knapsack problem, we are not allowed to break items. We either take the whole item or donâ€™t take it.


**I assume the weight of each item is an integer.**
**If the weight of each item in 0-1 Knapsack problem isn't an integer, then 0-1 Knapsack problem is NP problem.**
